      <description>Abstracts This is a technical log on our progress on the FOSS project. It is the second week of Sprint 1, and the Rochester weather is ever forgiving. My ankles were soaked in snow for at least three days straight, and my shoes had turned into a bleak white shade.
Our initial goal of Sprint 1 week 2 is to research and understand as much as possible about the Dat-js library as well as the DAT protocol as a whole from their white paper.</description>
